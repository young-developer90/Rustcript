# Rustcript

Rustcript is a memory-safe language inspired by Rust, Swift, TypeScript, and Python.

## Features

- `let` and `mut` for variable declaration
- Optional semicolons
- `unsafe {}` blocks for unsafe operations
- Python-style indentation for control flow: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Type annotations like `u8`, `u16`, etc.

## Build and Run

```bash
make
./rustcript examples/main.rscr
